	<h1>My three Final piece ideas</h1>
	<h3> "The black sheep of the family"</h3>

	<p>
This is from chapter. I was learning about visualmetaphor in Chris's lesson and I was looking for a quote that had a metaphor in and so I picked this one. When I read the quote, I had an idea of having loads of white guyfuks mask and then have one which was a black one. But then Chris said that too original and the mask is used everywhere so then I read it again and I thought about having funny looking sheep's that were white and have one black sheep that had the face off V( the main character) to make it relevant to the chapter. When I made that, I then positioned it to be like a v shape to represent the character as he was the one that said the quote.

<h3>"God is in the rain"</h3>
<p>I also did this in that same lesson where Chris was talking about visual metaphor. With this one I just went on google and went to the Goodreads website to find some random quote's from the book that showed metaphors and picked this quoted which was called “God is in the rain”. I did the outlines in illustrator. I had the idea of having loads of rain drops and have one focused one. I then decided to make a small world inside of the main drop to show that without rain, we wouldn't have land to start from. Some people believe that god created the world and used water as of the elements to do that which why it was vital to have one of the drops to show that.

<h3>"Our friend in the mask  had got quite a thing about the letter V wouldnt you say?"</h3>
<p> 
<span class="ink">This was my favourite one as it was so easy to make and it looks effect. This one is from chapter. After every kill V does, he always leaves a Violet Carson rose behind. So I got the image from google of that rose and put it on a layer. I then on a new layer added V's mask and only have one side. I read the quote again and I thought of having half of a "V" on the other side to make that V important as that was the soul focus of the this quote. I made sure both the mask and the letter "V"were black. After that I typed the two quotes from the two speech bubble and made sure the font was the custom Vendetta one, made sure both quotes black too and then I positioned it. I then converted the layer into smart object and placed it
above the rose layer. I then changed the top layer which had the concept in
to "lighten" which brought out this effect. </span></p>
